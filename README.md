# Musical Dublin
This site is intended as a go to site for both Irish people living in or visiting Dublin or tourists to get a comprehensive list of musical 
venues, education facilities and music shops in the city.




## Design
* Font Type:
1. The font chosen for the headings on the site is the 'Permanent Marker' font from Google fonts. This was chosen as it has a playful 
and non-formal look to it, suitable for a site dedicated to music. I felt it would be welcoming to the diverse usership that this site
is aimed at, at least more than for example, the [Blabbermouth](https://www.blabbermouth.net) logo font which is an obvious choice for a site
dedicated to heavy metal music and aimed mainly at fans of the genre. A fallback font of sans-serif is included in case a browser cannot load the Permanent Marker font. 
2. The font chosen for all other text on the site is 'Alegreya' from Google Fonts with a fallback font of sans-serif. This was chosen for 
its easy readability.
* Colour Scheme:
1. As this is a site focusing on musical activity within the Dublin area, I decided on a combination of blue colours similar to the Dublin County
flag. Four blue variants are used, these are Oxford Blue(#0A1128), Royal Blue(#001F54), Indigo Dye(#034078) and Celadon Blue(#1282A2).
The white colour, #FEFCFB, was used in the site because the Dublin GAA alternative jersey is a similar white colour and it contrasted with the 
other colours well. 
2. The colours were generated on an app called [Coolors](https://www.coolors.co) which gives five-colour lists of colours
that compliment each other well. I had the above reasons in mind when I decided on the particular list that I used.
* Images:
1. The images used all portray either concert venues, education facilities or music shops in accordance with the purpose of the site.
